## Description about database.

I am using the sqlite database for developing the Employee Management System and using this database, we can manage
each employee information, department information, timesheets of each employee and salary of each employee.

We using the relational database so it will make ease management and querying the data due to relational established 
among the tables through the foreign keys.

Employee Table: This is the main table of our application and this table will use to store the employee personal
information like employee id, name, mobile number, address and email address.

Timesheet table: This table is using the storing the time sheet details of the employee and this table has foreign 
key relationship to employee table. 

Salary table: This table is using for storing the salary of the employee and this table also has the foreign 
key relationship to employee table because employee is the root table in the database.

Department table: Department table is using for storing the department details of the employee.
